/* Registration: xxxx; Arithmetic Progression (A.P.) and Geometric Progression (G.P.). 

AP series is a sequence of terms in which next term is obtained by adding common difference 
to previous term. If tn be the nth term of A.P., then (n+1)th term of can be calculated as 
(n+1)th = tn + D, where D is the common difference (n+1)th - tn. Formula to calculate Nth 
term tn = a + (n â€“ 1)d, where a is first term of AP and d is the common difference. 

GP series is a sequence of terms in which next term is obtained by multiplying common ratio 
to previous term. The (n+1)th term of GP can be calculated as (n+1)th = nth x R, where R is 
the common ratio (n+1)th/nth. Formula to calculate Nth term of GP : tn = a x R^(n-1), where a 
is first term of GP.
